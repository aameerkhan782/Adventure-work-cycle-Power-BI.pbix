In this project I have Validated and analyzed the business of ADVENTURE WORKS CYCLE with the help of KPI metrics and visual charts using different tools. Such as MS excel, power bi, tableau, and MySQL. 
In this project i have created 3 DASHBOARD to understand the insight better i.e 

1. Customer Analysis Report
2. Product Analysis Report
3.Sales Analysis Report

Based on the Requirement of the client we have developed the visualization.


1. Sales Amount Calculation: I calculated the sales amount by multiplying the unit price with the order quantity and then subtracting the unit discount.

2. Production Cost Calculation: I calculated the production cost by multiplying the unit cost with the order quantity.

3. Profit Calculation: I calculated the profit by subtracting the production cost from the sales amount.

4. Pivot Table for Monthly Sales: I created a pivot table that displays the sales amount for each month. You can use the year filter to select a specific year.

5. Bar Chart for Yearly Sales: I created a bar chart that shows the sales amount for each year. This chart provides a visual representation of the sales performance over the years.

6. Line Chart for Monthly Sales: I created a line chart that displays the sales amount for each month. This chart helps in identifying any trends or patterns in the monthly sales data.

7. Pie Chart for Quarterly Sales: I created a pie chart that shows the sales amount for each quarter. This chart provides a clear visualization of the sales distribution across different quarters.

8. Combination Chart for Sales Amount and Production Cost: I created a combination chart that combines a bar chart and a line chart. This chart allows you to compare the sales amount and production cost together, providing insights into the profitability of the business.

Overall, this Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the sales performance, production cost, and profitability of the business. It helps in analyzing the data and making informed decisions based on the visual representations.
